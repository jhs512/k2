# Vault Workflows

Agent-agnostic workflow definitions for Infinite Brain automation. Each workflow can be triggered by any agent that supports scheduled tasks or cron execution.

---

## vault-health

**Trigger:** Weekly (recommended: Monday morning)
**Skill:** `/vault-health`
**Output:** `notes/note-vault-health-YYYYMMDD.md` + updated `_system/INDEX.md`

**What it does:**
1. Applies confidence decay to nodes not verified in 90+ days
2. Audits orphans, contradictions, stale signals, cross-link gaps, taxonomy, visibility, and summary quality
3. Writes a structured health report as a `note` node
4. Presents priority actions for human approval before executing any fix

**Two modes:**
- `/vault-health` — interactive: decay + audit + ask before each fix
- `/vault-health auto` — automated: decay + audit + report node only, zero fixes, zero prompts

**Setup by agent:**

### Claude Code
```bash
# Run once to register the weekly schedule (auto mode, no prompts):
/schedule weekly /vault-health auto
```

### GitHub Actions
Create `.github/workflows/vault-health.yml` — triggers the scheduled agent remotely via Claude Code CLI on a cron. See the GITHUB-ACTIONS section below.

### Cursor / Gemini CLI / Copilot
Skills live in the ib Claude Code plugin, not inside this vault. For non-Claude agents, point them at `_system/AGENTS.md` (operating rules) and apply the decay rules described in the vault-health skill (`/vault-health` Phase 1: −0.1 confidence at 91–180 days unverified, −0.2 at 181–365, floor 0.1).

## convert-note (on-demand, not scheduled)

**Trigger:** Manual — run after dropping files into `raw/`
**Skill:** `/convert-note`
**Output:** New typed nodes in their respective folders + updated `_system/INDEX.md`

No automation recommended — conversion requires human review of type classification.

---

## GITHUB-ACTIONS

To run `vault-health` as a GitHub Action (requires Claude Code CLI installed in the runner):

```yaml
# .github/workflows/vault-health.yml
name: Vault Health

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 8 * * 1'   # Every Monday at 08:00 UTC
  workflow_dispatch:        # Manual trigger

jobs:
  health:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run vault-health skill
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
        run: |
          npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
          claude --print --skill vault-health auto
      - name: Commit health report
        run: |
          git config user.name "vault-health[bot]"
          git config user.email "vault-health@users.noreply.github.com"
          git add notes/ _system/INDEX.md
          git diff --cached --quiet || git commit -m "chore: vault health report $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
          git push
```

> **Note:** `--skill vault-health` requires Claude Code CLI to support skill invocation via flag. Check current CLI docs — fallback is to pass the skill content as `--system-prompt`.

## Workflow Principles

1. **Automated phases never delete.** Decay modifies `confidence`. Audit only collects. Fixes require human approval.
2. **Every automated run writes a node.** The health report in `notes/` creates an audit trail inside the vault itself.
3. **Workflows are additive.** New automation should write nodes, not overwrite them. Old health reports are preserved with their date in the ID.
