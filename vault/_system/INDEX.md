## Adding New Nodes

When you create a new node:

1. Add a frontmatter block with all required fields per `_system/FRONTMATTER-SCHEMA.md`.
2. Assign a unique `id` in `type-slug` format.
3. Populate `edges` with at least one relationship to another node.
4. Update this index by inserting a row into the appropriate table.
5. Use `related` for informal wikilinks that don't need a formal edge.
6. `log` nodes are never added to this index — they are self-contained in `logs/`.
